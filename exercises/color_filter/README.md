# COLOR FILTER EXCERCISE
		
In this practice the intention is to develop a color filter that allow us to segment some object in the image. You will have to get in contact with RGB and HSV color spaces, and *OpenCV* (*Python*) library.

For the exercise, we will need a node to publish the video stream. The *video_stream_opencv* package contains this node.
Add this packages if you donâ€™t have it already:

`$ sudo apt install ros-melodic-video-stream-opencv`


For the realization of the practice, you are provided of a framework written in python that collects the images and allows its visualization. These images will be collected through several specific videos for this practice (pelota_roja.avi and pelotas_roja_azul.avi), although you could use your own videos instead or even a camera.

If you want to find the optimum values for your filter (in order to segment a concrete object) you can launch in a terminal the colorTuner component as follows (remember to run cameraserver tool as shown in line 39):

`$ colorTuner color_tuner_conf.yml`

This practice allows to obtain the video stream from 3 different sources:
- From a local camera (Local)
- A local file (Video)
- Or through an ICE or ROS video driver (Stream)
Depending on the way you want to obtain the video, you must specify the selected video
source in the configuration file (color_filter_conf.cfg), and the required paremeters for that source. 
Once done it, if you have selected either 'Local' or 'Video', follow the next step:

First, launch the ROS Server. Open the terminal with the directory set to *color_filter* in the exercises folder and run this command. 

` $ roslaunch color_filter.launch`

The above command opens the videostream and starts publishing it.
Next, ensuring you have written a workable code in MyAlogirthm.py file, run the following command.

`$ python2 ./color_filter.py color_filter_conf.yml`


If the selected video source is 'Stream', you must do the following:

First of all, ensure you have put the correct path in the configuraton file (cameraserver_conf.cfg) 
to the video over you want to apply the filter, and comment the line that access your local camera. This is:
```
[EXAMPLE]

CameraSrv.Camera.0.Uri = /home/username/Desktop/pelota_roja.avi
#CameraSrv.Camera.0.Uri=0
```

Once done it, in a terminal launch cameraserver component (ICE driver):
`$ cameraserver cameraserver_conf.cfg`

In other terminal launch the color_filter component:
`$ python2 ./color_filter.py color_filter_conf.yml`

## API
* `camera.getImage()` - to get the image received from server
* `camera.getColorImage()`
* `camera.setColorImage(input_image)` - to set color image
* `camera.getDetectImage()`
* `camera.setThresholdImage(bk_image)` - to set Threshold image
* `getDetectImage()
* `setDetectImage()`

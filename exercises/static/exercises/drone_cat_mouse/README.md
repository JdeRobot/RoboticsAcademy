# Drone Cat and Mouse Exercise

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to implement the logic that allows a quadrotor to play a game of cat and mouse with a second quadrotor.

In this exercise, the cat quadrotor is to be programmed by the student to follow the mouse quadrotor (which is preprogrammed and has random paths) as close as possible without crashing. The refree application will measure the distance between the two drones and assign a score based on it that is proportional to the time spent by the drones close to each other.

## Requirements

As this is a drones exercise, you will need to additionally install the `jderobot-assets`, `dronewrapper` and `rqt_drone_teleop` packages. These can be installed as

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-drone-wrapper ros-kinetic-rqt-drone-teleop ros-kinetic-jderobot-assets
```

There is an additional dependancy on MAVROS and PX4 that we are in the process of simplifying, however at the moment just use the script provided [here](https://github.com/JdeRobot/drones/blob/master/mavros_px4_sitl_installation.sh)

## Execution

To launch the exercise, simply use the following command from this directory:

`roslaunch drone_cat_mouse.launch`

## Solution

To solve the exercise, you must edit the my_solution.py file and insert the control logic into it. Your code is to be entered in the `execute` function between the `Insert your code here` comments.
[my_solution.py](my_solution.py#L46)

```python
def execute(event):
  global drone
  img_frontal = drone.get_frontal_image()
  img_ventral = drone.get_ventral_image()
  # Both the above images are cv2 images
  ################# Insert your code here #################################

  set_image_filtered(img_frontal)
  set_image_threshed(img_ventral)

  #########################################################################
```

## API

* `set_image_filtered(cv2_image)`: If you want to show a filtered image of the camera images in the GUI
* `set_image_threshed(cv2_image)`: If you want to show a thresholded image in the GUI
* `drone.get_frontal_image()` : Returns the latest image from the frontal camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_ventral_image()` : Returns the latest image from the ventral camera as a cv2_image
* `drone.get_position()`: Returns the position of the drone as a numpy array [x, y, z]
* `drone.get_orientation()`: Returns the roll, pitch and yaw of the drone as a numpy array [roll, pitch, yaw]
* `drone.get_roll()`: Returns the roll of the drone
* `drone.get_pitch()`: Returns the pitch of the drone
* `drone.get_yaw()`: Returns the yaw of the drone
* `drone.set_cmd_vel(vx, vy, vz, az)`: Commands the linear velocity of the drone in the x, y and z directions and the angular velocity in z in its body fixed frame

# Car Junction

The goal of this practice is to implement the logic of a navigation algorithm for 
an automated vehicle. The vehicle must Stop at the T joint, where there is a stop 
sign, wait until there are no cars and pass once the road is clear.

## How to execute?
To launch the example, follow the steps below:

0. Source the gazebo setups:

```
$ source /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/gazebo-setup.sh
$ source /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/assets-setup.sh
```

1. Run Gazebo simulator:

```
$ roslaunch /opt/jderobot/share/jderobot/gazebo/launch/car_1_junction.launch
```

2. Running the practice and the user interface: 

```
$ python2 ./stop.py stop_conf.yml
```

To simplify the closure of the environment, just close the Stop Component 
window(s). *Ctrl + C will give problems*.


## How to do the practice
To carry out the practice, you must edit the `MyAlgorithm.py` file and insert the 
control logic into it.


## Where to insert the code?

[MyAlgorithm.py](MyAlgorithm.py#L74)

```
def execute(self):
        
    # Add your code here
    print "Running"
    # Getting the images
    input_image = self.cameraC.getImage().data      
```


## API
* `self.cameraC.getImage().data` - to get image from center camera
* `self.cameraL.getImage().data` - to get image from left camera
* `self.cameraR.getImage().data` - to get image from right camera

* `self.pose3d.getPose3d().x` - to obtain the position of the robot
* `self.pose3d.getPose3d().y` - to obtain the position of the robot
* `self.pose3d.getPose3d().yaw` - to obtain the position of the robot

* `self.motors.sendW()` - to set the angular velocity
* `self.motors.sendV()` - to set the linear velocity

Robotics-Academy is also available as an **open-access web page**. This way you can enjoy it from the web browser on your favourite Operating System (Linux, Windows, MacOs...). No installation is required when using the _online_ Robotics-Academy.

**It is supported by a server cluster at the Universidad Rey Juan Carlos** (Madrid, Spain). The computing power of the cluster is bounded and there is a maximum of simultaneous users supported. When such limit is reached the web page will suggest you to play with the _native release_ of Robotics-Academy, which can run on your computer and it is easy to install.

## Versions to run the exercise

Currently, there are 2 versions for running this exercise:

- ROSNode Templates
- Web Templates(In Development)

The instructions for both of them are provided as follows.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to practice integrating navigation and manipulation. You will need to use a mobile manipulator(AGV+robot arm+gripper) to pick objects on one conveyor and place them on three other conveyors.

The mobile manipulator is MMO-500 robot from [Neobotix](https://www.neobotix-robots.com/homepage). They provides a set of ROS simulation packages and tutorials to test their mobile robot and mobile manipulators[1]. The MMO-500 is one of them, combining the omnidirectional robot MPO-500 with a light-weight robot arm UR10. The navigation part of this exercise is based on their provided packages.

{% include gallery caption="Gallery." %}

## Instructions

### Installation

- Download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). Windows users should choose WSL 2 backend Docker installation if possible, as it has better performance than Hyper-V.

- Pull the current distribution of  RoboticsBackend

	```bash
  docker pull jderobot/robotics-backend:2.4.2
  ```

- In order to obtain optimal performance, Docker should be using multiple CPU cores. In case of Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, the VM should be assigned a greater number of cores.

### Enable GPU Acceleration
- For Linux machines with NVIDIA GPUs, acceleration can be enabled by using NVIDIA proprietary drivers, installing  [VirtualGL](https://virtualgl.org/) and executing the following docker run command:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -it --device /dev/dri -p 7164:7164 -p 2303:2303 -p 1905:1905 -p 8765:8765 -p 6080:6080 -p 1108:1108 jderobot/robotics-backend:2.4.2 ./start.sh
  ```


- For Windows machines, GPU acceleration to Docker is an experimental approach and can be implemented as per instructions given [here](https://www.docker.com/blog/wsl-2-gpu-support-is-here/)

### How to perform the exercise?
- Start a new docker container of the image and keep it running in the background ([hardware accelerated version](#enable-gpu-acceleration))

	```bash
  docker run --rm -it -p 7164:7164 -p 2303:2303 -p 1905:1905 -p 8765:8765 -p 6080:6080 -p 1108:1108 jderobot/robotics-backend:2.4.2 ./start.sh
  ```

- On the local machine navigate to 127.0.0.1:7164/ in the browser and choose the desired exercise.

- Click the connect button and wait for some time until an alert appears with the message `Connection Established` and button displays connected. 

- The exercise can be used after the alert.

**Where to insert the code?**

In the launched webpage, type your code in the text editor,

```python
from GUI import GUI
from HAL import HAL
# Enter sequential code!


while True:
    # Enter iterative code!
```

### Using the Interface

* **Control Buttons**: The control buttons enable the control of the interface. Play button sends the code written by User to the Robot. Stop button stops the code that is currently running on the Robot. Save button saves the code on the local machine. Load button loads the code from the local machine. Reset button resets the simulation(primarily, the position of the robot).

* **Brain and GUI Frequency**: This input shows the running frequency of the iterative part of the code (under the `while True:`). A smaller value implies the code runs less number of times. A higher value implies the code runs a large number of times. The numerator is the one set as the Measured Frequency who is the one measured by the computer (a frequency of execution the computer is able to maintain despite the commanded one) and the input (denominator) is the Target Frequency which is the desired frequency by the student. The student should adjust the Target Frequency according to the Measured Frequency.

* **RTF (Real Time Factor)**: The RTF defines how much real time passes with each step of simulation time. A RTF of 1 implies that simulation time is passing at the same speed as recal time. The lower the value the slower the simulation will run, which will vary depending on the computer. 

* **Pseudo Console**: This shows the error messages related to the student's code that is sent. In order to print certain debugging information on this console. The student can use the `print()` command in the Editor. 

## Robot API

* `from HAL import HAL` - to import the HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) library class. This class contains the functions that sends and receives information to and from the Hardware(Gazebo).
* `from GUI import GUI` - to import the GUI(Graphical User Interface) library class. This class contains the functions used to view the debugging information, like image widgets.
* `HAL.back_to_home()` - Command the robot arm and gripper to move back to the home pose.
* `HAL.pickup()` - to set the linear speed
* `HAL.place()` - to set the angular velocity
* `HAL.move_pose_arm(pose_goal)` - Command the robot with Pose message to make its end effector frame move to the desired pose with inverse kinematics.
* `HAL.move_joint_hand(joint_value)` - Command the gripper joint to move to desired joint value.
* `HAL.get_object_pose(object_name)` - Return the pose of the object.
* `HAL.get_target_position(target_name)` - Return the position of target where we are going to place the objects.
* `HAL.get_target_pose(target_name)` - get the goal pose of the robot to stop in front of conveyor with target_name. The goal pose for each stop position is specified in navigation.yaml file.
* `HAL.send_goal_to_client(pose)` -  send the goal pose to move_base client.
* `HAL.get_result_from_client()` - get navigation result from client. If the result is True, navigation is finished.
* `HAL.move_to_pick_place_home([move_gripper=True])` - Command the robot arm and gripper to move back to the home pose to get ready for pick or place. If move_group is set to to False, the gripper wonâ€™t move.
* `HAL.spawn_obstacle_rviz()` - Spawn the model of obstacle in planning scene.

Then open a new terminal window, navigate to `mobile_manipulation` folder inside `exercises` folder and execute following command:
```bash
python MyAlgorithm.py
```
You can start running the algorithm with the start button when you see `You can start your algorithm with GUI` in the terminal.

## How should I solve the exercise
To solve the exercise, you must edit the MyAlgorithm.py file and insert control logic in myalgorithm() function. Before writing the main logic, you should implement move_to() function to navigate and move mobile robot to given target.
```python
def move_to(self, target_name):
    ############## Insert your code here ###############
    self.pick_place.send_message("move to "+target_name)
    ####################################################

def myalgorithm(self, stopevent, pauseevent):
	############## Insert your code here ###############
    # Move the robot arm back to home as a start
    self.pick_place.back_to_home()
	
    # insert following two lines where you want to pause or stop the algorithm 
    # with the stop button in GUI
    while (not self.pauseevent.isSet()) or (not self.stopevent.isSet()):
        if not self.stopevent.isSet():
            return

    ##### A brief example to pick green cylinder on conveyor1 and place it to conveyor2 #####

    ## Move to the target pose to stop in front of conveyor1
    self.move_to("conveyor1")

    ## Pick green cylinder

    ## Move to the target pose to stop in front of conveyor2
    self.move_to("conveyor2")

    ## Place green cylinder
    
    ####################################################
```  

## API
### Navigation
- `self.client.get_target_pose(target_name)` - get the goal pose of the robot to stop in front of conveyor with target_name. The goal pose for each stop position is specified in `navigation.yaml` file.
- `self.client.send_goal_to_client(pose)` - send the goal pose to move_base client.
- `self.client.get_result_from_client()` - get navigation result from client. If the result is `True`, navigation is finished.

Following APIs are provided in Pick_Place class, so you should always add "self.pick_place." as a prefix to following introduced APIs in your algorithm.
### Environment Information
* `get_object_list()` - Return the name list of all objects.
* `get_object_info(object_name)` - Return the height, width, length, shape, color of the object in order.
* `get_object_pose(object_name)` - Return the pose of object in the robot arm frame.
* `get_target_list()` - Return the name list of all targets.
* `get_target_position(target_name)` - Return the position of target where we are going to place the objects.
* `get_target_pose(target_name)` - Return the pose(x, y, theta) where the robot will stop in front of the target conveyor.

### Convert Pose Message
* `pose2msg(roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z)` - Convert pose to Pose message. The unit of roll, pitch, yaw is radian.
* `pose2msg_deg(roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z)` - Convert pose to Pose message. The unit of roll, pitch, yaw is degree.
* `msg2pose(pose)` - Convert Pose message to pose, return roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z in order. The unit of roll, pitch, yaw is radian.
* `msg2pose_deg(pose)` - Convert Pose message to pose, return roll, pitch, yaw, x, y, z in order. The unit of roll, pitch, yaw is degree.

### Basic Robot Movement
* `move_pose_arm(pose_goal)` - Command the robot with Pose message to make its end effector frame move to the desired pose with inverse kinematics.
* `move_joint_arm(joint_0,joint_1,joint_2,joint_3,joint_4,joint_5)` - Command the robot joints to move to desired joints value.
* `move_joint_hand(finger1_goal[, finger2_goal = 10, finger3_goal = 10])` - Command the gripper finger joint to goal value. If `finger2_goal` and `finger3_goal` are kept as 10, they will set to be the same as `finger1_goal`. The range of finger goal value is [-1.57, 1.57].
* `back_to_home([move_gripper=True])` - Command the robot arm and gripper to move back to the home pose for moving process. If `move_group` is set to to False, the gripper won't move.
* `move_to_pick_place_home([move_gripper=True])` - Command the robot arm and gripper to move back to the home pose to get ready for pick or place. If `move_group` is set to to False, the gripper won't move.

* `clean_all_objects_in_scene()` - Remove all the model of objects ready to be picked in planning scene.

### Pick and Place
* `pickup(object_name, position, width[, distance = 0.12])` - Command the industrial robot to pick up the object by moving the end effextor to given position. Width is the goal gripper joint value. Distance is the distance the robot arm will move in z axis before and after grasping objects.
* `place(object_name, position[, width = -0.2, distance = 0.12])` - Command the industrial robot to place the object by moving the end effector to given position. Width is the goal gripper joint value. Distance is the distance the robot arm will move in z axis before and after placing objects.

## Theory

### Navigation
Navigation part is implemented by following steps. It is based on the simulation packages from Neobotix which integrated `amcl`, `gmapping`, `eband_local_planner` and some other related packages. If you are interested in the details of navigation implementation in ROS, check out their [tutorial website](https://docs.neobotix.de/display/ROSSim/ROS-Simulation).
1. **Built the map of the world**: A map of the world is prebuilt using `gmapping` package. If we want to change the world, a new map need to be generated and saved.
2. **Localization**: The `amcl` package is used to localize the robot. The odometry message of the robot will be published in `/odom` topic which contains the pose between robot `base_link` and `odom` frame.
3. **Navigation**: The `move_base` package will use both global planning and local planning to plan a path to the goal position, and drive the robot to achieve it.

### Manipulation
Manipulation part is implemented by following steps. 
1. **Load object info**: Load the information of objects and obstacles from yaml file, including absolute pose, size, shape, color.
2. **Move to pick position**: Make the robot stops in target position in front of the conveyor.
3. **Pick up object**
    - Move the robot arm to home position for pick and place task.
    - Get robot pose from `/odom` topic and caculate the relative pose between object and robot.
    - Spawn the model of objects and conveyor into planning scene.
    - Move to some distance above the object, move down and grasp the object.
    - Delete the model of objects and conveyor in planning scene.
4. **Move to place position**: Move robot arm to home position with the object in the gripper and move the mobile robot to the target position.
5. **Place object**
    - Move the robot arm to home position for pick and place task.
    - Get robot pose from `/odom` topic and transform the place target position from world frame to robot frame.
    - Spawn the model of conveyor into planning scene.
    - Move to some distance above the object, move down and grasp the object.
    - Delete the model of conveyor in planning scene.

## Hints

### How to get the object pose and pick it up?
Motion planning for the robot arm is done by MoveIt in robot arm frame, so we need to know where are the objects we are going to grasp and where are obstacles and goal position to place objects.
The poses of objects and obstacles in the world frame are known and assumed to be fixed until the objects are picked up. The robot pose and transformation between the base link of mobile manipulator and the base link of robot arm are also available, so the poses of objects and obstacles in robot arm frame can be computed. This part is implemented implicitly in API and available in get_object_position() and get_target_position(), but you still need to add objects and objects into planning scene before picking or placing and clean them before mobile robot moving to next position in the world.

### Why does the gripper cannot stably grasp and release the object?
We are using gazebo_grasp_fix plugin for this exercise and the Pick Place exercise which compute the force vector between fingers to check collision and distance between object and fingers to decide whether release the object. It is because Gazebo cannot well simulates manipulation behavior. JUst keep in mind that though you might see the object shaking when the gripper is grasping it in simulation, it can usually success in the same condition in real world.
The input `position` for pickup() and place() function are both the position for the end of the gripper in releasing mode. The output position of get_object_position() is the position of the center of the object. Therefore, because when the gripper is grasping, final end point position will change, please remember to tune the input position to pick and place. In addition, sphere is the most difficult to grasp. Cylinder and box are easier if you use proper parameters.

### Why does the mobile robot sometimes stops for a while after reaching the goal pose?
When the mobile robot doesn't reach a pose within tolerance range of goal pose, it might stops for a while to check if it can improve its pose.

### Object and Target lists:
**Object list:**
- blue_box
- yellow_ball
- green_cylinder

**Target list:** 
- `conveyor1`(main conveyor with objects on it)
- `conveyor2`(green tray)
- `conveyor3`(yellow tray)
- `conveyor4`(blue tray)

### Ignorable ERROR and WARNING
- `No p gain specified for pid.`

Following three errors can be ignored in the beginning, but if it keep spawning when you run your algorithm or move the robot with GUI, please relaunch the exercise.
- `Spawn service failed. Exiting.`
- `wait_for_service(/controller_manager/load_controller): failed to contact, will keep trying`
- `No laser scan received (and thus no pose updates have been published)`
- `Timed out waiting for transform from base_link to map to become available before running costmap`

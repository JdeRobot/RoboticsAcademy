# RoboticsAcademy: Learn Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision

JdeRobot Academy is an **open source**  platform that has a collection of exercises to learn robotics in a practical way. Gazebo simulator is the main tool required for testing with ROS. Its latest documentation (including installation recipes, current available exercises and illustrative videos) is on its <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy">webpage</a>.

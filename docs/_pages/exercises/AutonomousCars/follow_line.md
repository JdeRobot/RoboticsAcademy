## Versions to run the exercise

Currently, there are 2 versions for running this exercise:

- ROSNode Templates
- Web Templates(Current Release)

The instructions for both of them are provided as follows.

## Goal

The goal of this exercise is to perform a PID reactive control capable of following the line painted on the racing circuit.

{% include gallery caption="Gallery" %}

The students will program a Formula1 car in a race circuit to follow the red line in the middle of the road.

## Instructions for Web Templates
This is the preferred way for running the exercise.

### Installation 
- Clone the Robotics Academy repository on your local machine

	```bash
git clone https://github.com/JdeRobot/RoboticsAcademy
	```

- Download [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

- Pull the current distribution of Robotics Academy Docker Image

	```bash
docker pull jderobot/robotics-academy
	```

- In order to obtain optimal performance, Docker should be using multiple CPU cores. In case of Docker for Mac or Docker for Windows, the VM should be assigned a greater number of cores.

#### Enable GPU Acceleration (For advanced users)
- For Linux machines, GPU acceleration can be enabled by downloading Nvidia Container Runtime, as given [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-runtime)

- For Windows machines, GPU acceleration to Docker is an experimental approach and can be implemented as per instructions given [here](https://www.docker.com/blog/wsl-2-gpu-support-is-here/)

### How to perform the exercise?
- Start a new docker container of the image and keep it running in the background

	```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 7681:7681 -p 2303:2303 -p 1905:1905 -p 8765:8765 jderobot/robotics-academy python3.8 manager.py
	```

- On the local machine navigate to the follow_line exercise which is: `RoboticsAcademy/exercises/follow_line/web-template`

- Inside `assets\websocket_address.js` , change the variable websocket_address to the IP address through which the container is connected. Usually for Linux machine it is `127.0.0.1` and for Windows is `192.168.99.100`.

- Launch the `index.html` web-page. Wait for some time until an alert appears with the message `Connection Established`. 

- The exercise can be used after the alert.

**Where to insert the code?**

In the launched webpage, type your code in the text editor,

```python
from GUI import GUI
from HAL import HAL
# Enter sequential code!


while True:
    # Enter iterative code!
```

### Using the Interface

* **Control Buttons**: The control buttons enable the control of the interface. Play button sends the code written by User to the Robot. Stop button stops the code that is currently running on the Robot. Save button saves the code on the local machine. Load button loads the code from the local machine. Reset button resets the simulation(primarily, the position of the robot).

* **Frequency Slider**: This slider adjusts the running frequency of the iterative part of the code(under the `while True:`). A smaller value implies the code runs less number of times. A higher value implies the code runs a large number of times. The Target Frequency is the one set on the Slider and Measured Frequency is the one measured by the computer(a frequency of execution the computer is able to maintain despite the commanded one). The student should adjust the Target Frequency according to the Measured Frequency.

* **Debug Level**: This decides the debugging level of the code. A debug level of 1 implies no debugging at all. At this level, all the GUI functions written by the student are automatically removed when the student sends the code to the robot. A debug level greater than or equal to 2 enables all the GUI functions working properly.

* **Lap Time**: The lap timer starts once the Robot car, moves beyond some point on the race track.

* **Psuedo Console**: This shows the error messages related to the student's code that is sent. In order to print certain debugging information on this console. The student is provided with `console.print()` similar to `print()` command in the Python Interpreter. 

**Application Programming Interface**

* `from HAL import HAL` - to import the HAL(Hardware Abstraction Layer) library class. This class contains the functions that sends and receives information to and from the Hardware(Gazebo).
* `from GUI import GUI` - to import the GUI(Graphical User Interface) library class. This class contains the functions used to view the debugging information, like image widgets.
* `HAL.getImage()` - to get the image
* `HAL.motors.sendV()` - to set the linear speed
* `HAL.motors.sendW()` - to set the angular velocity
* `GUI.showImage()` - allows you to view a debug image or with relevant information

## Instructions for ROSNode Templates

### Installation 
Install the [General Infrastructure](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/installation/#generic-infrastructure) of the JdeRobot Robotics Academy.

### How to perform the exercise?
To carry out the exercise, you have to edit the file `MyAlgorithms.py` and insert in it your code, which gives intelligence to the autonomous car.

**Where to insert the code?**

In the `MyAlgorithm.py` file,

```python
def execute(self):
    #GETTING THE IMAGES
    image = self.getImage()

    # Add your code here
    print "Runing"

    #EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SEND INFORMATION TO THE ROBOT ACTUATORS
    #self.motors.sendV(10)
    #self.motors.sendW(5)

    #SHOW THE FILTERED IMAGE ON THE GUI
    self.set_threshold_image(image)
```

**Application Programming Interface**

* `self.getImage()` - to get the image
* `self.motors.sendV()` - to set the linear speed
* `self.motors.sendW()` - to set the angular velocity
* `self.set_threshold_image()` - allows you to view a debug image or with relevant information. It must be an image in RGB format (Tip: np.dstack())

### How to run your solution?

- Navigate to the follow_line directory

	```bash
cd exercises/follow_line
	```

- Launch Gazebo with the f1_simple_circuit world through the command 

	```bash
roslaunch ./launch/simple_line_follower_ros.launch
	```

- Then you have to execute the academic application, which will incorporate your code:

	```bash
python2 ./follow_line.py follow_line_conf.yml
	```

## Theory

PID Control is the main fundamental behind this exercise. To understand PID Control, let us first understand what is Control in general.

### Control System

A system of devices or set of devices, that manages, commands, directs or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems to achieve the desired results. Simply speaking, a system which controls other systems. Control Systems help a robot to execute a set of commands precisely, in the presence of unforeseen errors.

### Types of Control System
#### Open Loop Control System
A control system in which the control action is completely independent of the output of the system. A manual control system is on Open Loop System.

#### Closed Loop Control System
A control system in which the output has an effect on the input quantity in such a manner that the input will adjust itself based on the output generated. An open loop system can be converted to a closed one by providing feedback.

### PID Control
A control loop mechanism employing feedback. A PID Controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between desired output and the current output and applies a correction based on proportional, integral and derivative terms(denoted by P, I, D respectively).

- **Proportional**

Proportional Controller gives an output which is proportional to the current error. The error is multiplied with a proportionality constant to get the output. And hence, is 0 if the error is 0.

- **Integral**

Integral Controller provides a necessary action to eliminate the offset error which is accumulated by the P Controller.It integrates the error over a period of time until the error value reaches to zero.

- **Derivative**

Derivative Controller gives an output depending upon the rate of change or error with respect to time. It gives the kick start for the output thereby increasing system response.

### Tuning Methods

In order for the PID equation to work, we need to determine the constants of the equation. There are 3 constants called the gains of the equation. We have 2 main tuning methods for this.

- **Trial and Error**

It is a simple method of PID controller tuning. While system or controller is working, we can tune the controller. In this method, first we have to set Ki and Kd values to zero and increase proportional term (Kp) until system reaches to oscillating behavior. Once it is oscillating, adjust Ki (Integral term) so that oscillations stops and finally adjust D to get fast response.

- **Zeigler Nichols method**

Zeigler-Nichols proposed closed loop methods for tuning the PID controller. Those are continuous cycling method and damped oscillation method. Procedures for both methods are same but oscillation behavior is different. In this, first we have to set the p-controller constant, Kp to a particular value while Ki and Kd values are zero. Proportional gain is increased till system oscillates at constant amplitude.

## Hints
Simple hints provided to help you solve the follow_line exercise.

### Detecting the Line to Follow
The first task of the assignment is to detect the line to be followed. This can be achieved easily by **filtering the color of the line** from the image and applying basic image processing to find the point or line to follow, or in Control terms our *Set Point*. Refer to these links for more information:

[3](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22470902/understanding-moments-function-in-opencv)

### Coding the Controller
The Controller can be designed in various configurations. 3 configurations have been described in detail below:

- **P Controller**
The simplest way to do the assignment is using the P Controller. Just find the error which is the difference between our *Set Point* (The point where our car should be heading) and the *Current Output* (Where the car is actually heading). Keep adjusting the value of the constant, till we get a value where there occurs no [**unstable oscillations**](#Illustrations) and no [**slow response**](#Illustrations).

- **PD Controller**
This is an interesting way to see the effect of Derivative on the Control. For this, we need to calculate the derivative of the output we are receiving. Since, we are dealing with *discrete outputs in our case, we simply calculate the difference between our previous error and the present error*, then adjust the proportional constant. Adjust this value along with the P gain to get a good result.

- **PID Controller**
This is the complete implemented controller. Now, to add the I Controller we need to integrate the output from the point where error was zero, to the present output. While dealing with discrete outputs, we can achieve this using *accumulated error*. Then, comes the task of adjustment of gain constants till we get our desired result.

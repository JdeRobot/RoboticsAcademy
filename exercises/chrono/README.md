# Chrono practice
The objective of this practice is to perform a PID reactive control capable of following the line painted on the racing circuit as quickly as possible. It's a chorno test, so your car may be the fastest one on the track.


### How to execute?

To launch the infrastructure of this practice, first launch the simulator with the appropriate scenario:

`$ roslaunch f1-chrono.launch`

Then you have to execute the academic application, which will incorporate your code:

`$ python2 chrono.py`

## How to do the practice?
To carry out the practice, you have to edit the file MyAlgorithms.py and insert in it your code, which gives intelligence to the autonomous car.

### Where to insert the code?
[MyAlgorithm.py](MyAlgorithm.py#L74)
```
    def execute(self):
        #GETTING THE IMAGES
        imageLeft = self.sensor.getImageLeft().data
        imageRight = self.sensor.getImageRight().data

        # Add your code here
        print "Runing"

        #EXAMPLE OF HOW TO SEND INFORMATION TO THE ROBOT ACTUATORS
        #self.sensor.setV(10)
        #self.sensor.setW(5)

        #SHOW THE FILTERED IMAGE ON THE GUI
        self.setRightImageFiltered(imageRight)
        self.setLeftImageFiltered(imageLeft)
```

### API
* `cameraL.getImage()` - to get the left image of the stereo pair
* `motors.setV()` - to set the linear speed
* `motors.setW()` - to set the angular velocity
* `self.setRightImageFiltered()` - allows you to view a debug image or with relevant information. It must be an image in RGB format (Tip: np.dstack())

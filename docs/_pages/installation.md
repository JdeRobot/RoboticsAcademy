**Robotics-Academy (2.3 release)** supports Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04 and other distributions), MacOS and Windows. The installation has been greatly simplified, as all the required dependencies are already pre-installed in the Robotics-Academy Docker Image. The users of this release should:

1. Install the [RADI (Robotics-Academy Docker Image)](https://hub.docker.com/r/jderobot/robotics-academy/tags) on their machines
2. Copy the [Robotics-Academy source code repository](https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/installation/#robotics-academy-source-code) on their machines. 

Enjoy :-)

**Robotics-Academy (both 2.1 and 2.0 releases)** currently supports Linux operating system. These installation instructions have been prepared for Ubuntu Linux 18.04 (LTS). Don't install everything listed here, just follow the directions on the Academy exercise you want to perform. For instance, not all the specific infrastructure packages are required for every exercise, and they can be large packages.

1. *Generic infrastucture*
    - Required
    - ROS middleware, Gazebo simulator, JdeRobot-base, JdeRobot-assets

2. *Specific infrastructure*
    - Optional, depends on the exercise
    - Some exercises require also additional software pieces such as OpenCV, MoveIt!, MavROS, PX4, VisualStates, OpenMotionPlanningLibrary, Turtlebot2, etc.

3. *Robotics-Academy source code*
    - Required
    - Robotics-Academy includes templates for the exercises

# Generic infrastructure

## Real Turtlebot2 on ROS Melodic

0. Prerequisites
- ROS Melodic on Ubuntu 18
- Turtlebot2

1. Build Turtlebot2 Workspace

Firstly, `cd` to your catkin workspace. 

If you don't have one, `cd` to somewhere you want to create it, and then run the following commands to create one
```bash
mkdir -p src
catkin_make
```

Now run the following command (inside the root of catkin workspace) to build up running environment for Turtlebot2
```bash
curl -sLf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gaunthan/Turtlebot2-On-Melodic/master/install_basic.sh | bash
catkin_make
```

2. Bring Up Turtlebot2
Now connect a turtlebot2 to the computer. After that, run this command to bring up the Turtlebot2
```bash
source ./devel/setup.bash
roslaunch turtlebot_bringup minimal.launch
```

If nothing wrong, you will hear the Turtlebot2 give out a reminder.

3. Test Turtlebot2
If you want to use keyboard to control it, just run the following command
```bash
source ./devel/setup.bash
roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
```

And it will output something like this

```bash
ROS_MASTER_URI=http://localhost:11311

process[turtlebot_teleop_keyboard-1]: started with pid [23757]

Control Your Turtlebot!
---------------------------
Moving around:
   u    i    o
   j    k    l
   m    ,    .

q/z : increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
w/x : increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
e/c : increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%
space key, k : force stop
anything else : stop smoothly

CTRL-C to quit

currently:	speed 0.2	turn 1 
```

Now you should be able to use keyboard to control your Turtlebot2.

4. Asus Xtion

Install dependencies:
```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rgbd-launch ros-melodic-openni2-camera ros-melodic-openni2-launch
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-rqt ros-melodic-rqt-common-plugins ros-melodic-rqt-robot-plugins
```

Run these commands on three different terminals to test it:
```bash
roscore
```
```bash
roslaunch openni2_launch openni2.launch
```
```bash
rqt
```

In this last application, `rqt`, go to `Plugins` -> `Visualization` -> `Image view` -> `depth/image_raw` to view the camera depth raw data.

5. RPLidar

Just test it! Run these commands on two different terminals:
```bash
roscore
```
```bash
roslaunch rplidar_ros view_rplidar.launch 
```

## MoveIt!

# Robotics-Academy source code

Once you have generic and specific infrastructure installed in your system, you can download and install the JdeRobot Academy software.

1. Clone the Academy software repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JdeRobot/Academy.git

# Installation on Windows(x64)  DEPRECATED

The programming environment is composed of the (a) Docker with Gazebo simulator, (b) JdeRobot middleware for Python and (c) the TeachingRobotics package. All this software is open source so there are alternative ways to install all of them directly from the source code. Currently we use Gazebo-7.4.0, JdeRobot-5.4.1 and TeachingRobotics-0.1.0 releases. JdeRobot Docker includes the Gazebo plugins, models and configuration files to simulate the robot used in the exercises.

### Prerequisites

First check that you have the following dependencies installed. If not, you can install them in the links provided.

# RoboticsAcademy: Learn Robotics, Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision

JdeRobot Academy is an **open source** platform that provides a collection of exercises for learning robotics in a practical way. Its latest documentation (including installation recipes, current available exercises and illustrative videos) is on its <a href="https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy">webpage</a>. RoboticsAcademy is completely ROS-based, and includes robotics standard tools like Gazebo and Rviz. 

If you are a contributor, please note that we use GitHub Pages and a Jekyll theme (MinimalMistakes) for the Academy web page. Feel free to install Jekyll locally, so that, you can test your changes before submitting your pull-request.
